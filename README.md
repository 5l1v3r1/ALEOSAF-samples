Running the samples
-------------------

We recommend the use of ALEOS AF Developer Studio for a smoother experience.

### ALEOS AF Developer Studio

[Download ALEOS AF Developer Studio](http://developer.sierrawireless.com/en/Resources/Resources/Tools/ALEOS_AF_Studio.aspx), it is *strongly recommended* to read its [getting started](http://developer.sierrawireless.com/en/Resources/Resources/Educational_Documentation/Tutorial_AAF_Getting_Started.aspx) to master its features and concepts.

### Add Git support to ALEOS AF Developer Studio

All installation instructions are [available on EGit website](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/).
If you are not familiar with Eclipse based products, have a look to the [installation from update site manual](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm).

### Setting up the environment

Once you have ALEOS AF Developer Studio and EGit both installed, you just have to import  a *Team Project Set* and samples are directly fetched from Github to your workspace. Here is the URL to import:

* `http://sierrawireless.github.com/ALEOSAF-samples/resources/aleosafworkingset.psf`

If you are not familiar with *Team Project Set .psf*  files, there is [documentation available](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Project_Set_File).
