-------------------

You are free to set up your environment manually, but recommend the use of [Konedi LDT](http://eclipse.org/koneki/ldt/) for a smoother experience.

### Install Koneki Lua Development Tools

It is [all explained here](http://eclipse.org/koneki/ldt/#installation).

### Install Git support in Koneki LDT

All installation information is [available on their website](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/).
If you are not familiar with Eclipse base product, installation from update site manual is [available here](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm).

### Setting up the environment

Once you have Koneki LDT and EGit both installed, you just have to import `aleosafworkingset.psf` and samples are directly fetched from Github to your workspace.  
If you are not familiar with *Team Project Set .psf*  files, it is [all explained here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Project_Set_File).
